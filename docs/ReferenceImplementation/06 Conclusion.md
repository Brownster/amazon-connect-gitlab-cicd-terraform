# Conclusion

In this workshop, you have learned how to set up GitLab CI/CD to securely deploy Amazon Connect and associated resources across accounts and regions using Terraform IaC. Through practical hands-on experience, you configured OIDC authentication for your GitLab pipelines, created deployment roles, set pipeline variables, and triggered automated deployments of an end-to-end Amazon Connect Contact Center solution. By leveraging Terraform modules and separating components into logical pipelines, you built a structured, scalable foundation for delivering continuous delivery of Connect flows, lambdas, and supporting infrastructure. Dynamic references via contact attributes were used instead of hard-coded ARNs to enable portability across accounts and regions. Finally, you validated the deployed contact center by claiming a number, logging in as an agent, and taking a test call.

There are many possibilities to enhance your contact center delivery through infrastructure as code. Using GitLab CI/CD as your CI/CD engine gives you the flexibility to easily spin up new environments and evolve your Amazon Connect solution while maintaining governance, reducing errors, and speeding up delivery of new features.
